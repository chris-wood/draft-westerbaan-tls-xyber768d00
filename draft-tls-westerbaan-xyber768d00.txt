1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The final draft for Kyber is expected in 2024.  There are already
   early deployments of post-quantum key agreement, with more to come
   before Kyber is standardised.  For compatibility, this meme specifies
   a preliminary hybrid post-quantum key agreement.

2.  Construction

   We instantiate draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-06 with X25519 [rfc8037]
   and Kyber768Draft00 [kyber].  The latter is Kyber as submitted to
   round 3 of the NIST PQC process [KyberV302].  For motivation of the
   hybrid design, see [hybrid].

   For the client's share, the key_exchange value contains the
   concatenation of the client's X25519 ephemeral share and the client's
   Kyber768Draft00 public key.

   For the server's share, the key_exchange value contains the
   concatenation of the server's X25519 ephemeral share and the
   Kyber768Draft00 ciphertext returned from encapsulation for the
   client's public key.

   The shared secret is calculated as the concatenation of the X25519
   shared secret between both shares and the Kyber768Draft00 shared
   secret.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This key agreement is assigned the TLS named group
   x25519_kyber768_draft00=0xfe31.
